# INTRODUCTION :

RKE (Remote Keyless Entry):
Remote keyless entry (RKE) is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. 
RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that
 will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock. 
 Typically, the action is to press a button on a physical fob or mobile app.
Remote keyless entry, which is commonly used to protect vehicles from theft,
 can be contrasted with passive keyless entry (PKE), which does not require any 
 action on the part of the end user. Most RKEs operate at a frequency of 315 MHz for North America-made 
 cars and at 433.32 MHZ for European, Japanese and Asian cars. Modern systems since the mid-1990s implement 
 encryption as well as rotating entry codes to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the signal.
  A controller chip in the receiver changes the exact frequency required for RKE each time the lock is accessed, 
  a security feature known as rolling code or hopping code.
